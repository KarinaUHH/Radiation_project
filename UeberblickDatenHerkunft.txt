Venus: 
5/6 Oktober 1991; X-Band 3.6 cm (0.278 Keyser); f = 8.426 GHz, Orbit 3212
Mission_name: MAGELLAN alias VENUS RADAR MAPPER (VRM) (1989-05-04 to 1994-10-12) 

Mars: 
Mission_name: MARS EXPLORATION ROVER, (start: 20000-05-08, launching: 2003)
The IMUs were not science instruments and thus nominally there was no       
 science objective for their inclusion on the spacecraft. The measured        
 deceleration values provided by the IMU, as a function of time (which        
 needs to be used to determine the height above the surface).                 
 the surface, can be employed to deduce the vertical structure of density     
 and pressure, and ultimately temperature of the atmospheric column           
 traversed by the lander as it descended through the atmosphere.       
 
 Titan: 
 14. Jan 2005
 Mission_name: CASSINI-HUYGENS
 Instrument: Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument (HASI)
pt thermometer
HASI scientific objectives are:
- Determine the atmospheric pressure and temperature profiles. 
During the parachute descent, nominally beginning at 170 km, pressure and 
temperature will be measured directly by pressure and temperature sensors with
access to the unperturbed field outside of Huygens' boundary layer. Both the 
measured temperature and pressure, T_meas and p_meas, could need dynamic 
corrections: 
 T_corr = T_meas - (r V_r^2) / (2 c_p)                                     (2)
 p_corr = p_meas - (rho V_r^2) / 2                                 (3)
